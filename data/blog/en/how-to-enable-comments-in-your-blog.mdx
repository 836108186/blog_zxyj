## Introduction

After experimenting with **Hugo** and **Notion** for blogging, I decided to build my own blog project from scratch.  
Here‚Äôs the repo üëâ [https://github.com/836108186/blog_zxyj](https://github.com/836108186/blog_zxyj)

Once I got the basics running using **Tailwind + Next.js Starter Blog**, I quickly realized something:

> A blog without comments just feels a bit lonely ‚Äî there‚Äôs no real conversation happening.

So, I compared several comment systems (like Disqus, Utterances, and Gitalk) and finally settled on **Giscus** ‚Äî a backend-free comment system powered by GitHub Discussions.  
Here‚Äôs my full setup guide and some pitfalls I ran into.

---

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository with Discussions Enabled

<Callout type="note" title="Quick Tip">
Giscus relies on **GitHub Discussions**, so you must enable the Discussions feature in your repo.
</Callout>

Before using Giscus, make sure you have a **GitHub repository** ready.  
If you‚Äôre using **Next.js Starter Blog**, simply click **‚ÄúUse this template‚Äù** at the top right of the repo to create your own blog.  
Otherwise, just create a new repo manually ‚Äî it‚Äôs quick.

![Enable Discussions](/blog/how-to-enable-comments-in-your-blog/20251011151804.png "Enable Discussions")

<Callout type="success" title="Summary">
Once Discussions are enabled, Giscus can properly sync comment threads between your blog and GitHub.
</Callout>

## 2. Install the Giscus App

<Callout type="note" title="Quick Tip">
The Giscus App acts as a bridge between your blog and GitHub Discussions, authorizing comment reading and writing.
</Callout>

To allow visitors to post comments, you must install the **Giscus App** on GitHub.

1. Visit [https://github.com/apps/giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus)  
2. Click **Install** (or **Configure** if you already have it installed);  
3. Select the repository you want to use for comments.  

After installation, Giscus gains permission to create and manage discussion threads under your repo‚Äôs Discussions tab.

---

## 3. Generate the Giscus Script

Go to [https://giscus.app](https://giscus.app), and you‚Äôll see a configuration generator.  
Here‚Äôs what you need to do:

- Select your repo (e.g., `username/blog-repo`);  
- Choose ‚ÄúDiscussions‚Äù as the category;  
- Adjust your theme and language;  
- Copy the generated `<script>` code.

You‚Äôll later paste this snippet into your blog‚Äôs article template.

---

## 4. Add the Giscus Script to Your Next.js Blog

Open your blog project (e.g., based on `Next.js Starter Blog`) and locate the component that renders post content ‚Äî typically `components/Comments.tsx` or the bottom of your post layout file.

Paste your `<script>` snippet there. Example:

```tsx
  <script
    src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
    data-repo="yourname/yourrepo"
    data-repo-id="repo id"
    data-category="General"
    data-category-id="Category ID"
    data-mapping="pathname"
    data-reactions-enabled="1"
    data-emit-metadata="0"
    data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
    async
  ></script>
```
Once saved, deploy your site again.
Now your blog posts should display a comment section that connects directly to GitHub Discussions.

![](/blog/how-to-enable-comments-in-your-blog/20251011152439.png)

<Callout type="success" title="Summary">
After deployment, the comment section will appear at the bottom of your post  
and sync in real time with your GitHub Discussions.
</Callout>

## 5. Common Issues & Tips

### ‚ùå Giscus not showing up?
- Double-check that the **repository** and **category IDs** match.  
- Ensure your blog domain is listed under ‚Äúallowed origins‚Äù in the Giscus app settings.  

### üåì Dark mode issues?
- Use `data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"` to automatically switch themes based on the user‚Äôs system preference.

### üîê Permissions error?
- Reinstall the Giscus App and make sure it has access to your comment repo.
<Callout type="note" title="TIPS">
Most issues are related to authorization or configuration settings.  
Double-check your `repo_id` and Discussions configuration first.
