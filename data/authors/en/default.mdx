Welcome to XiaoYan Notes — a corner of the internet where I document what I'm learning and the ideas that grow along the way.

## About this site

---

> **XiaoYan Notes** is a collection of small yet honest reflections.
> It's not about grand declarations, but about the *quiet dialogue between myself and the world*.
> Here you'll find the *fleeting sparks of everyday life, the ordinary inspirations, and the thoughts that take root slowly*.

If any of the posts here help you, I'm truly grateful to be part of your journey.

## About sponsorship and ads

---

Traffic here is modest, but to keep the site running long term I rely on a few lightweight ads. A sustainable blog needs some support, yet high-quality writing remains the best experience I can offer.
If the ads ever get in your way, feel free to whitelist the site — your support means a lot. Thank you.
